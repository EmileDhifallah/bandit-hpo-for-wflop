# bandit-hpo
_A Python-based hyperparameter optimization repository serving as an extension to the WFLOPG library_

This repository contains implementations of early-stopping based hyperparameter optimization techniques that can be used 
to optimize wind farm layout optimization problems in the context of pseudo gradients. In the bandit_hpo subdirectory,
the algorithms successive halving, hyperband and hyperucb algorithms can be found, as well as baseline approaches grid search and
random search. The data folder contains all data sets (folder has separate README with more details) that were used in the 
experimentation phase of this Bachelor End Project.
