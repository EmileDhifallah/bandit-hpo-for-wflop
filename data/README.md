For the sake of reusability, all problem files that were used in experimentation for my BEP are listed below.

-problem-IEA37_Optimization_Case_Study-small;
-problem-IEA37_Optimization_Case_Study-medium;
-problem-IEA37_Optimization_Case_Study-large;
-problem-IEA37_CS3;
-problem-Mosetti_et_al;
-problem-Mosetti_et_al-WLP;

besides the problem files, corresponding layout-, site-, wind resource- and turbine-files are included are present in this folder. 

Whenever an optimization run is executed, only the problem file needs to be provided, but all other corresponding files are used in this process too.
